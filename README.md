We started our project with a vision that our software will make the entry and exit of a vehicle in the premises like university 
fully autonomous. We succeeded in making our project to work on our expectations but still it has some problems left on which we have 
to work more . Our project uses python language to use artificial intelligence to convert image of number plate into text and then store
that information in a database. On the exit of vehicle , it will again sense the vehicle and make it exit from the database. It also has 
other functions like telling how many vehicles are currently there in the university and also , it tells us the detail of every vehicle 
present in the university.
